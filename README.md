# Simple React Portfolio

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is the source code of a simple portfolio website using React.
You can find a video of me building it on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/f6Imh_Kr5vk).

You are free to use the code for your own projects however you like.

## Vite

This project is using Vite. 
Vite is a new build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. 
It is built on top of Rollup and esbuild, and it is written in TypeScript.
For more information, check out the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
